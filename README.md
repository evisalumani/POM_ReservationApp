# Android app for hypothetical restaurant reservation

The app was developed as part of the course ["Project Organization and Management" at TU MÃ¼nchen](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/WBMODHB.wbShowMHBReadOnly?pKnotenNr=261729).
The app is rather hypothetical, no database or server-side code is used. The focus was on practicing agile methodologies.
